  eventDescription: As you enter the room, you notice that the room almost in pristine
    condition and has very lush vegetation. At the centre of the room there is a
    fountain with clear water

  choiceHeader: I will..
  choiceOneHeaderTxt: 'Drink:'
  choiceOneDescriptionTxt: Drink from the fountain, seems refreshing!
  choiceTwoHeaderTxt: 'Taste:'
  choiceTwoDescriptionTxt: Vegetation doesn't look poisonous, taste one of the leaves
  choiceThreeHeaderTxt: 'Leave:'
  choiceThreeDescriptionTxt: It's a nice room, nothing for me here though
  choiceOneGood: Refreshing indeed!
  choiceOneBad: After a sip, first you feel fine, but after a few moments you feel
    sick and notice that the lush vegetation begins to wither away and the water
    in the fountain turns slowly into black muck. The room was not really in pristine
    condition at all, it was an illusion. What on earth did you consume..
  choiceTwoGood: As you are about to take a bite, the leaf gives you a small paper
    cut in your finger. It's unusually sharp.. you pocket the leaf.
  choiceTwoBad: You consume the leaf. Your stomach begins to hurt so badly you cannot
    move for a while. Eventually the pain stops, but you feel weakened.
