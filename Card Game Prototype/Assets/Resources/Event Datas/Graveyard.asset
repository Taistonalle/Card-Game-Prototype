  eventName: Makeshift graveyard
  eventDescription: 'You stumble upon what looks like somekind of a makeshift graveyard.
    As you look around you notice that there is a strange looking statue above one
    the graves. Upon closer look, statue is bleeding from it''s eyes and near the
    statue you notice a shovel. Looks very worn. '

  choiceHeader: I will...
  choiceOneHeaderTxt: 'Respect:'
  choiceOneDescriptionTxt: Bow before the statue and pay your respects for graves
  choiceTwoHeaderTxt: 'Dig:'
  choiceTwoDescriptionTxt: Dig the grave! There could be something!
  choiceThreeHeaderTxt: 'Leave:'
  choiceThreeDescriptionTxt: Place is too creepy for longer stay, better to move
    on
  choiceOneGood: Statue stops bleeding from the eyes. You feel like you have given
    peaceful treatment to the area.
  choiceOneBad: "Suddenly you feel a massive pressure around you. The statue's mouth
    begins slowly to move into a grinning position. You prepare yourself for battle,
    but since the pressure seems to be growing ever stronger, you feel faint. Your
    own eyes begin to bleed and your vision starts to flicker to black until you
    pass out. \nWhen you eventually wake up, the statue is gone and your vision is
    back to normal."
  choiceTwoGood: 'The shovel endures. Yet you find nothing. At one point you could
    have sworn you saw the statue have a tiny grin on it''s mouth..

    Or maybe
    you are just seeing things. You move on..'
  choiceTwoBad: Shovel breaks since it's too worn out. You kick the statue in frustration,
    but hurt yourself while doing so.
