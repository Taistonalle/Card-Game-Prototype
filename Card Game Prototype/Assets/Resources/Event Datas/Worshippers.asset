  eventDescription: Entering the room you notice you are not alone. You see a lot
    of fragile looking men worshipping a shrine and hear a strange prayer among the
    men

  choiceHeader: What to do..
  choiceOneHeaderTxt: 'Join:'
  choiceOneDescriptionTxt: Join the worshippers and try to learn the prayer
  choiceTwoHeaderTxt: 'Kill:'
  choiceTwoDescriptionTxt: Kill the worshippers. This cannot be any good
  choiceThreeHeaderTxt: 'Leave:'
  choiceThreeDescriptionTxt: Leave them to it, they seem harmless
  choiceOneGood: '"Haven''t seen you before..", one of the worshippers takes interest
    in you. You explain you wish to learn the prayer they are chanting. He smiles
    and puts his hand inside his robe. He hands you a old looking scroll. "Glad to
    have one more believer".'
  choiceOneBad: You approach the men, the closer you get the louder their chanting
    becomes until you get close enough for them to notice you. They stop their chanting
    and slowly turn their heads towards you. Very uneasy feeling begins to creep
    on you as the room is now dead silent and worshippers are staring at you. The
    next time you blink, everything is gone and you stand alone in the room.
  choiceTwoGood: One by one, you slay the worshippers. None of the worshippers pay
    attention to you, as if you were not there at all. On the last kill, chanting
    finally stops. You look at the shrine they were woshipping. "Yes... you seem
    worthy...", you hear the words coming out of the shrine and feel a bit.. different?
  choiceTwoBad: 'As your attack is about to land in one of the worshippers, he instantly
    turns around and grabs your hand. You look up and take a look at the other worshippers.
    Something sinister is happening. Worshippers begin to transform and grow tiny
    horns and their muscles grow at alarming speed. The one who grabbed your hand
    looks at you and says in demonic voice: "Well.. looks like our blood sacrifice
    came righ to us".

    He pierces your skin with his nails and you feel the blood
    flowing towards him. Then he tosses you out of the room.'
